Using the Home Media app you can view video and images, listen to audio files located on a media server (UPnP), in local network (SAMBA) or saved to external media connected via the USB interface. The section includes the Recordings virtual folder. You can use it to access files recorded with the help of the TimeShift and PVR functions and saved to one or more data carriers connected to the device. The Favorites folder stores IPTV channels marked with a star by the user in the corresponding app. It also contains selected media files from external media and other items.
