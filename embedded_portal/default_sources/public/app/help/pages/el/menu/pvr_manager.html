<p>
The Recording Manager offers a list of current, planned and completed recordings (since the last device restart) made via the IPTV Channels application (the PVR function).
</p>

<p>
When you press the <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/f1.png" class="media" alt="" /> button while viewing an IPTV channel, the recording window pops up containing the following fields: recording start and stop time (you can schedule your recordings in advance), its duration, a channel name, media to save the recording, an end file name. If the user lefts the file name field empty, the default name will include the recording start time and *.ts extension.
You can add a new recording directly in the Recording Manager using a similar pop-up window. The recorded file will be saved to the selected media. A folder will be created automatically: Records/Channel name/Recording date. It can be accessed via the Recordings folder in the Home Media section. 
</p>

<p>
!Note: the number of active recordings (recordings in process) is limited to five. 
</p>

<p>
Status of recordings in the list is displayed in front of their names. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="pages/el/menu/../images/type_91.png" class="media" alt="" /> – still waiting (the recording is scheduled for later time)
</p>

<p>
<img src="pages/el/menu/../images/type_92.png" class="media" alt="" /> – in process (the line with its current status is also displayed) 
</p>

<p>
<img src="pages/el/menu/../images/type_93.png" class="media" alt="" /> – unsaved recordings interrupted due to an error (lack of space; wrong time of recording start and/or stop; too many active recordings)
</p>

<p>
<img src="pages/el/menu/../images/type_94.png" class="media" alt="" /> – saved recordings ready for playback when <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/ok.png" class="media" alt="" /> pressed. 
</p>

<p>
Main control keys:
</p>

<p>
<img src="pages/el/menu/../images/f4.png" class="media" alt="" /> – quick search and filtrate the download list 
</p>

<p>
<img src="pages/el/menu/../images/f1.png" class="media" alt="" /> – add a recording (the window interface is similar to its prototype in the IPTV Channels section). If the file name field is left empty, recording start time becomes the default file name 
</p>

<p>
<img src="pages/el/menu/../images/f2.png" class="media" alt="" /> – select one or more recordings in the list (for example, when deleting old files)
</p>

<p>
<img src="pages/el/menu/../images/info_old.png" class="media" alt="" /> or <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/info.png" class="media" alt="" /> – display the recording info: a recorded file name (complete or in process), its status, recording start and stop time, a channel name.
</p>

<p>
<img src="pages/el/menu/../images/stop.png" class="media" alt="" /> - Stop the current recording (selected recordings) still “in process”
</p>

<p>
The modal menu (press the <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/menu_old.png" class="media" title="MENU" alt="MENU" /> or <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/menu.png" class="media" title="MENU" alt="MENU" /> button to open) includes three groups of additional settings:

<p>
<em>Note: If during content recording the external media runs out of space, the recording will be aborted and marked as an error in the Recording list. The recorded file can be viewed only via the Home Media application (to be found in the Recordings folder)
If a message about lack of free space is displayed before the recording starts, you can connect another media and restart the recording using it.</em>
