<p>
When viewing an IPTV channel, you can use the TimeShift function (delayed playback). With the help of the TimeShift, you can pause live air and start from the same moment later. The TimeShift function supports only the channel you are watching currently. If you switch channels, the TimeShift starts a new recording for every new channel. 
</p>

<p>
IPTV channels supporting the TimeShift function are marked in the IPTV channels list by an icon located to the right (a circular arrow with a Play sign inside). 
</p>

<p>
<em>Note: The TimeShift function is to be pre-activated and pre-set by the user in the Settings menu (more about it in the Settings section). </em>
</p>

<p>
To start recording, press the <img src="pages/en/menu/iptv_channels/../../images/playpause.png" class="media" title="«Play/Pause»" alt="«Play/Pause»" /> button. The image on the screen becomes static, a status line of the record appears. The current recording time is displayed in the left pane. To the right is the maximum record time specified in the settings. 
If the TimeShift icon was activated in the settings, it will be displayed during recording in the upper left corner (a circular arrow with a red dot inside).
If any value was specified for the Delay option, recording of the stream will start automatically after the specified delay time. 
When pressed again, the <img src="pages/en/menu/iptv_channels/../../images/playpause.png" class="media" title="«Play/Pause»" alt="«Play/Pause»" /> button stops the recording. Now you can watch the show starting from the moment when recording was activated. You can control the recorded video with the help of the rewind buttons. 
The <img src="pages/en/menu/iptv_channels/../../images/stop.png" class="media" title="«STOP»" alt="«STOP»" /> button interrupts the recording process and turns on the real time playout mode. 
If the automatic save or save request were not pre-activated in the settings, the record will be lost. 
When the user tries to switch between channels with the TimeShift recording active, a pop-up window appears “Save the record or quit without saving?” (if the Save Request option was activated in the settings before).
