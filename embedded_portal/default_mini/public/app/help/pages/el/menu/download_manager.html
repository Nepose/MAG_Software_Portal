<p>
The Download Manager is a list of downloads saved by the user. They can be saved from your web browser, from bookmarks, or from the application itself using a direct download link.
</p>

<p>
When working with a web browser (including the Bookmarks menu item) you can open a direct link to the displayed content or search and select it manually. In the latter case two options are offered: to view the content or to download it. The View option opens a built-in media player and displays the selected content. The Download option opens the Download Manager and the Create Download window with filled-in boxes. Now you can choose the media (if needed) and click <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/ok.png" class="media" title="ОК" alt="ОК"> To exit the Download Manager and return to the current page in your web browser, press the <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/app.png" class="media" title="АРР" alt="АРР"> button on the remote.
</p>

<p>
Every download has a status: downloading, saving, interrupted due to an error, suspended. Files downloaded successfully are marked with the <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/type_94.png" class="media" alt=""> marker, files still downloaded are marked with <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/type_91.png" class="media" alt="">. Downloads with errors are marked with <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/type_93.png" class="media" alt="">, while suspended downloads are marked with <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/type_90.png" class="media" alt="">. To playback completed downloads with audio or video files, choose the <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/ok.png" class="media" title="ОК" alt="ОК"> button.
