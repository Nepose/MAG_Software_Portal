The Weather App displays a 3-day weather forecast at the selected location and detailed information on current weather conditions there. 
The basic default location (your city or town) is set in the Settings Wizard. Current weather for the default location is displayed in the Main Menu. A forecast can be found in the Weather App. The user can change the location directly in the app using the Search function (press <img src="pages/el/menu/../images/f4.png" class="media" title="F4" alt="F4"> button). 
The search supports auto complete name suggestions: after you begin to type in a location name the system offers you variants starting with similar letters.  
When exiting the app, you can save the edited location to change it everywhere. Or you can cancel your changes and leave the default location pre-set in the Settings Wizard.
