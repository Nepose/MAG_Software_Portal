The menu item includes settings of the TimeShift function used for delayed playback when watching IPTV channels. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Use TimeShift</strong> – The TimeShift function on/off.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>Icon On/Off</strong> – Displays the TimeShift icon during recording.
</p>

<p>
<strong>File location</strong> – Allows you to specify a USB-connected external media for saving video recordings.
</p>

<p>
<strong>TimeShift Maximum Duration</strong> – Defines maximum recording time.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Buffer Mode</strong> – Cyclic Buffer (default) or Stop When Filled. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cyclic Buffer</strong> – After the pre-set time was specified in the Maximum Duration field, the system starts deleting previously recorded content and replacing it with new data. Perfect for delayed playback of long videos with an external media device of limited capacity. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Stop When Full</strong> – When the TimeShift buffer is full, the recording stops automatically and the system displays the ‘Buffer full’ message.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Action When Exit</strong> – To Save Buffer, Not to Save Buffer, Save Query. Depending on selected variant, the system saves the recorded content automatically or does not save it. If the Save Query option was selected, a message “Save the buffer content?” is displayed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Delay</strong> – When the TimeShift function is activated, the current IPTV channel is automatically saved to the buffer in 1, 3, 5, or 10 seconds after turning it on. You can set the delay before recording process starts. If the Pause When Button Pressed option was selected, automatic recording is deactivated. To start recording, the user presses the <img src="pages/es/menu/settings/../../images/playpause.png" class="media" alt=""> button.
