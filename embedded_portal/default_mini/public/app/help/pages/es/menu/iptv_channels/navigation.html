Enter the country of your location, your city and the Internet provider you are connected to. To add an open access playlist choose the Add IPTV list item in the modal menu and enter a link to a file in m3u format. You can also download a playlist file from external media connected via USB using the Home Media section (select the item you need, press <img src="pages/es/menu/iptv_channels/../../images/ok.png" class="media" title="«ОК»" alt="«ОК»"> and then <img src="pages/es/menu/iptv_channels/../../images/f3.png" class="media" alt=""> - Add content to IPTV channels).
